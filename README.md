# Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Transmission of Watermarked MRI Images

Wireless transmission of medical images plays a crucial role in telemedicine and remote diagnostics. However, conventional systems based on separate source and channel coding suffer from the "cliff effect", where image quality degrades sharply under poor channel conditions. This work proposes a robust Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) framework to ensure secure and high-fidelity transmission of watermarked MRI brain tumor images using the BRATS dataset. Watermark embedding is performed via a DWT-HD-SVD technique, preserving medical authenticity and security. The encoded images are transmitted over noisy channels using a DJSCC model with RNN-CNN encoder-decoder architecture, eliminating the need for traditional compression. A Predictive and Adaptive Deep Coding (PADC) mechanism with OraNet is introduced to dynamically predict Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and adjust the compression ratio based on image content and channel conditions to enhance reliability. Attention mechanisms enable intelligent feature prioritization for efficient bandwidth use. Experimental results under AWGN and Rayleigh fading conditions show that the proposed system achieves higher PSNR and Normalized Correlation (NC), and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) values compared to traditional methods, confirming improved visual quality and watermark robustness. This adaptive and semantic-aware approach demonstrates strong potential for real-time, secure image transmission in healthcare applications.
